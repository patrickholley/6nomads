I do not currently have large-scale personal projects, as I focus my programming efforts on my current professional positions. Feel free to look around my GitHub profile if you care to, but know that much of it is not representative of more than fun ideas or significantly inexperienced work.

I am open to inquiries on the nature of my experience.
